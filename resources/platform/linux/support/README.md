# Support Scripts

This folder contains two shell scripts to register and de-register
the Camunda Modeler as the default editor for BPMN and DMN
files.

We use xdg-utils from <https://www.freedesktop.org/> that
are supported by all major Linux desktop environments.

## Register

Use the script `./xdg_register.sh` register the modeler.

## Unregister

Use the script `./xdg_unregister.sh` to revert the registration.
