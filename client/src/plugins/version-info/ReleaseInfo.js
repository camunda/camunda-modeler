          <h4>Connection manager</h4>
          You can now create and store multiple connections using the settings, and easily switch between connections from the status bar.

          <h4>Enhanced element template support</h4>
          Element templates now support templating timer events, enabling reusable timer configuration across processes.
          If an applied template is missing in the current configuration, its ID and version are displayed.

        <li>
          <h4>Task testing improvements</h4>
          The incident error message is now displayed in a readable format. Task testing supports process applications, and uses the configured tenant ID if provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Bug fixes and more</h4>
          As always, this release incorporates bug fixes and additional minor improvements.
